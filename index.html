  steward: {
    name: "The Steward", core: "Safety", color: "#6B8F71", light: "#EBF2EC", accent: "#8DB393",
    motto: '"Stability creates security."', emoji: "🛡️",
    description: "You instinctively treat money like a foundation — not a scoreboard, not a toy, not a way to prove anything. Money is the thing that keeps the floor from wobbling. When you're at your best, you create a kind of quiet strength that other people can feel just by standing near you: we're okay. We've planned. We're prepared.",
    origin: "Stewards often become Stewards honestly. Sometimes it's because they grew up around instability — financial, emotional, or both — and learned early that calm doesn't magically arrive. You build it. Sometimes it's because they've carried responsibility for other people: kids, a partner, parents, a team. Sometimes it's simply temperament: your nervous system relaxes when there's structure and a buffer.",
    protecting: [
      "Predictability — I can count on my future.",
      "Dignity — I won't have to beg, borrow, or scramble.",
      "Relational safety — My family won't suffer because I was reckless.",
      "Freedom from panic — I don't want money emergencies to run my life.",
    ],
    healthySays: [
      "\"I sleep better when the bills are paid ahead.\"",
      "\"I don't want lifestyle inflation to trap us.\"",
      "\"I want to be able to handle a surprise without drama.\"",
      "\"I'm not against fun — I just don't want fun to become fragile.\"",
    ],
    coreMotivation: "Peace of mind.",
    coreFear: "Instability — especially the kind that feels humiliating or out of control. This doesn't mean you're anxious or pessimistic. It often means you've seen what happens when people don't plan. You've watched someone unravel from a single unexpected bill. You've simply recognized that 'winging it' is not a strategy you want to bet your nervous system on.",
    gift: "You understand, deep in your bones, that financial stability is emotional stability. You build systems that reduce stress: automated savings, predictable spending, a clear emergency fund, insurance, debt payoff plans, and conservative choices that keep life from tipping. Your gift is turning abstract fear into concrete systems that create peace.",
    strength: "Your caution kept you safe. You built stability out of chaos — and that's a real gift. You're almost alchemical: you can take a messy financial life and gently turn it into something steady.",
    shineExamples: "You create budgets that actually match reality, build emergency funds in small consistent steps, pay off debt with patience and persistence, choose affordable housing even when others judge, and think in seasons and buffers rather than best-case scenarios. A Steward couple might choose the 'smaller, older house' so they can have a more spacious life overall: less stress, more margin, fewer fights.",
    shadow: "But here's the thing: your story can become so effective that it starts to feel like the only safe way to live. As life stabilizes, the next chapter asks for something different — more desire, more risk tolerance, more willingness to choose something that isn't fully guaranteed. You've built a solid house — but you won't step outside unless you can predict the weather for the next decade.",
    shadowDetails: "Opportunity shows up, but it's uncertain — a new job, a move, a business idea, a mini-retirement. You can see the upside and also fourteen ways it could go wrong. Life starts asking for aliveness, not just stability. You might feel an ache: 'We're safe… so why do I still feel stuck?' The emergency fund becomes a fortress. Savings keep growing, but permission doesn't.",
    eightyPercent: "Safety stops being a feeling and starts being a cage. The very discipline that gave you peace now steals it. You've optimized so thoroughly that spontaneity feels reckless. Fun requires a spreadsheet. Pleasure needs justification. You hit a moving goalpost — there's always one more month to save, one more scenario to prepare for.",
    eightyVignette: "Picture this: dessert arrives at dinner. You can afford it — a hundred times over. But something in you hesitates. You do the math. The cost per enjoyment unit. Whether it's 'worth it.' Often you choose the safe path. You order water. You feel a flash of satisfaction — you've stayed on script. Except the script is exhausting you.",
    eightySignals: [
      "The goalpost keeps moving. You've \"made it\" by every rational measure, but you still don't feel safe enough to relax.",
      "Spontaneity triggers irritation. An unplanned expense feels like a betrayal.",
      "Fun requires mental accounting. You've started budgeting for joy, which somehow made joy disappear.",
      "You feel secretly envious of people who seem to \"waste\" money freely — and slightly superior. Both at once.",
      "Your biggest fear isn't scarcity anymore — it's being caught with your guard down.",
    ],
    gives: "You create peace. You're the one who makes sure the lights stay on, the plan exists, and everyone can breathe.",
    quote: '"I\'ll relax when I know we\'re safe."',
    naturalStrengths: [
      "Creating predictable systems — you know how to build something reliable. Lean into this as a gift, not a cage.",
      "Building financial resilience — you've figured out how to bounce back. You're antifragile. That's rare and powerful.",
      "Spotting fragility — while everyone else is dancing, you see the structural weakness. That's wisdom, not paranoia.",
      "Keeping life calm — in a chaotic world, you've created pockets of peace.",

        title: "Borrow Agency from the Architect",
        why: "You've mastered protection. Now borrow the Architect's skill of bounded risk — the ability to say yes and no simultaneously. The Architect turns safety from paranoid vigilance into a clear framework. Once the frame is set, you're free within it.",
        practices: [
          "Use 'Yes, if' planning: say yes to the dream, then fill in the safety conditions. 'Yes to the trip — if we protect the runway first.' This lets you move without abandoning your values.",

          "Spend money this week specifically to increase closeness — host a dinner, buy a friend coffee, or invest in a shared experience. No ROI calculation. The return is relational.",
          "Practice one act of generosity that makes you slightly uncomfortable. Not reckless — just past your usual edge. A bigger tip, a surprise gift, paying for someone's groceries.",
          "Ask someone you trust: 'What's one way I could show up more?' Listen without defending. The Nurturer is comfortable with vulnerability — borrow that.",
          "Create a monthly 'People Budget' — money specifically earmarked for relationship investment. Dinners, gifts, experiences with the humans who matter most.",
        ],
      },
    },
    updatedStory: "Safety isn't just something I preserve — it's something I feel. The shift isn't about saving less. It's about redefining what safety is. Safety isn't the absence of risk. It's the presence of resilience strong enough to absorb risk. It's knowing your parachute is packed well enough that you can actually jump.",

Fun lives at the bottom of the list, where it rarely survives.", tinyIdea: "Planning joy is not unspontaneous. It's protective." },

A movie at the theater. A massage. A meal out with no special occasion. Tell yourself: 'This is not a hole in the boat. This is a window.'", storyToQuestion: "\"I need a reason.\" The translation? Desire isn't a good enough reason.", tinyIdea: "Desire is not the enemy. It's guidance." },
        { title: "Micro-Spontaneity", theme: "I can be safe without being rigid.", exercise: "Do one spontaneous thing this week that costs money. Same-day decision. No overthinking. Grab ice cream. Stop at the bookstore. Say 'yes' to the invite.", storyToQuestion: "\"We don't do things last minute.\" The translation? Spontaneity is danger.", tinyIdea: "Spontaneity is a muscle. You strengthen it gently." },

What did you love before life got so serious? Then choose one and build a 90-day plan to include it.", storyToQuestion: "\"Being responsible means minimizing wants.\" The translation?

    motto: '"If I design well, I\'ll stay free."', emoji: "📐",
    description: "You treat money like a design tool. Not a moral issue. Not a measure of worth. Money is leverage. It's optionality. It's the ability to shape your future instead of inheriting it. You can look at a constraint and say, \"Okay. Let's solve for that.\"",
    origin: "Architects often become Architects honestly. Sometimes they've lived inside systems that felt confining — tight budgets, demanding jobs, rigid family expectations, institutions that didn't make room for their humanity. Sometimes they've watched what happens when people have no choices and decided: that will not be me. And sometimes it's simply how their mind works: they see patterns, trade-offs, and pathways. They feel calm when they can map the terrain.",
    protecting: [
      "Agency — I can choose rather than react.",
      "Optionality — I'm not cornered.",
      "Mobility — I can pivot, leave, renegotiate, relocate.",

      "\"I'm building a runway.\"",
      "\"The goal isn't more money — it's more freedom.\"",
    ],
    coreMotivation: "Freedom through agency.",
    coreFear: "Being trapped — in a job, a relationship dynamic, a financial situation, or an identity that no longer fits. This doesn't mean you're commitment-phobic or unstable. It often means you've learned that good intentions don't protect you from constraint. Choices do. Systems do. Margins do.",
    gift: "You don't just hope for a better future — you engineer one. You create systems and strategies: income diversity, savings buffers, scalable skills, negotiation tactics, flexible housing, contingency plans. You're comfortable asking, 'What's the highest-leverage move here?' and then taking it.",
    strength: "Your strategy created options. Where others saw walls, you built doors. You can take a life that feels boxed in and build escape routes — without drama, without fantasy, and often without burning anything down.",
    shineExamples: "You negotiate for remote work or better pay, build savings runways, diversify income streams, reduce recurring expenses to buy back time, make strategic career moves with re-entry in mind, and treat a mini-retirement like a design problem, not a daydream. An Architect couple might choose to live below their means not out of fear, but because they want a life with more choice.",
    shadow: "But here's the catch: your story can become so effective that life starts to feel like a perpetual optimization project. Once you reach stability and flexibility, the next step asks for presence, savoring, the ability to stop improving life long enough to actually live it. The future becomes a horizon you never arrive at. There's always another tweak, another strategy. Joy gets delayed. Even rest has a purpose. Even fun has an ROI.",
    shadowDetails: "Life turns into a spreadsheet. Even relationships can become 'systems.' You struggle to let go of control — because control has been your path to safety. You can't be present without improving. You can't take a walk without mentally restructuring your day around it.",
    eightyPercent: "It's Saturday morning. Gloriously unscheduled. And almost immediately, your mind starts moving. Errands. Reorganizing. Batch-cooking. You time-block the tasks, create a plan so good that by the time you're done, you're exhausted. A day off that required more energy management than a regular workday. You've turned rest into a project.",
    eightyVignette: "The paradox: you have more options than ever, but freedom is slipping away. Because freedom, it turns out, requires the ability to do nothing. To be suboptimal. To have thoughts and feelings that don't fit into a plan.",
    eightySignals: [
      "You can't be present without improving. Even leisure requires optimization.",
      "Plans multiply. For every task, a sub-plan. For every day, a backup. For the backup, a contingency.",
      "Agency has become exhausting. Having options was supposed to feel freeing — instead, every choice feels loaded.",
